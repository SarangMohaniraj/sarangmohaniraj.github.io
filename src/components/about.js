      <div className="section-content">
        <p>I am currently a senior at South Brunswick High School and will major in Computer Science at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign starting this fall. I plan to specialize in Machine Learning. I usually program in either Python or Java, but I also work on front-end projects as needed.</p>
        <p>I dedicate full effort the each of my projects because I enjoy doing it. I am a little weird because I love using best practices and making my code reusable, so I often create a complete implementation for everything as if I am maintaining a popular library. I also love learning for the sake of learning. For example, I am fascinated with algorthims and their complexities, so efficiency plays a big role in my projects.</p>
        <p>I also spend a lot of time serving the community with the South Brunswick Leo Club. I am the current president have initiated many new projects for the club such as the Leo 5k Run.</p>
