/**
 * Sass will phase out "@import" over the next few years
 * Switch to "@use" to import partial scss files (ex. _header.scss) and import variables in the global namespace ("as *")
 * Currently, node-sass doesn't support the @use rule
 * Although dart-sass is the primary implementation of Sass, node-sass is faster, so it is not worth switching because
 * @import is still supported and is the exact way this project would use @use anyway.
 *
 * It is worth switching to @use once node-sass supports the new Sass module system because @import will be discontinued down the line
